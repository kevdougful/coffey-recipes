## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lbs. Boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed into bite-size pieces
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 cup flour
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 4 cups milk
- 1 diced green bell pepper
- 1/2 cup diced green onions
- 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 12 oz frozen peas
- 3 cups white rice

## Directions

1. [Cook rice](https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/articles/how-to-make-perfect-rice-a-step-by-step-guide). Note: I use an Instant Pot, so I do 1:1 rice:water.
2. Melt butter in large stock pot.
3. Once butter is melted, saute the peppers in the butter for a few minutes.
4. After peppers have begun to soften slightly, add the chicken and cook completely. (Try to get a little [fond!](https://food52.com/blog/12331-how-to-make-sauce-out-of-your-pan-s-brown-bits-a-k-a-fond))
5. Add flour and mix thoroughly, it should be quite pastey now. Allow this to cook for about 5 minutes.
6. While the flour is cooking, mix the milk and broth together and warm to ~150°F.
7. Begin adding the warmed liquid to the pot slowly at first. With each addition, fully incorporate the liquid into the flour mixture. Keep slowly adding liquid and mixing until it's all in the pot. 
8. Add in onions and let this heat under low-medium heat, stirring regularly (scrape the bottom!) until thickened.
9. Once this mixure reaches boiling (look for bubbles, or 212°F), stir in frozen peas.
10. Serve over rice.
